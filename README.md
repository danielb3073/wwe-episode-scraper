# wwe-episode-scraper
A python script that scrapes a list of RAW, SmackDown, and PPV episodes for any given year.

To use the script, you'll need to have Python3 and pip installed.
I'm using `Python 3.8.2` and `pip 23.0.1`

1. Open a command prompt/terminal and navigate to the folder with the script and requirements.txt
2. Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the script with `python wwe.py <year>` where `<year>` is the year of WWE you want to scrape.

The script will grab all RAW, SmackDown and PPVs for that year, and sort them into a list by aired date, which will allow you to watch them all in order.
